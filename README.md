## Hi there 👋, I'm Kaloyan!

#### I am an aspiring Game Engineer, currently studying at CMGT at Saxion. 🕹️
<p>
  I have always loved video games and programming, so when the time came and I graduated from highschool, I made the only logical decision - to enroll in the CMGT program. 😃
</p>
I am highly interested in gameplay and graphics programming and in finding ways of applying physics and mathematics into the game development process. 🍎
